  <h1>Initial Setup and Important Settings</h1>
  <p class="introduction">Save yourself a headache, let's get started!</p>

  <h3><b>Welcome</b></h3>
  <p>Welcome to Lightspeed Restaurant! <br /><br />
  There are two main parts of Lightspeed Restaurant, the <b>Manager</b> and the <b>Point of Sale</b>. <br /><br />
  Most of the setup is done through the <b>Manager</b>, which can be accessed from both an iPad and a web browser on a regular computer. We recommend using a regular computer for ease of use while setting up. 
<br /><br />
  The <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/lightspeed-restaurant-pos/id474723658?mt=8" target="_blank"><b>POS</b></a> (Point Of Sale) app is used for taking orders, processing payments, and day-to-day tasks such as opening and closing the cash register counts. <br />
</p>  

<h4>IMPORTANT SETTINGS FOR ALL USERS - PLEASE READ</h4>
<p><b>Taxes</b><br />
-First, check to see if Tax Inclusive pricing is turned On or Off. This feature is typically turned off in North America: <br /><br />
1. From the <a href="http://www.lightspeedpos.com/restaurant/en/login/" target="_blank"><b>Manager</b> </a>click on <b>Settings</b> in the top-right corner of the screen. <br />
2. Scroll down to <b>App Settings</b> and check (to turn on) or uncheck (to turn off) the option <b>Include VAT</b>.<br />
3. Press <b>Save</b> at the bottom of the window.<br /> <br />

-Make sure your taxes are correctly applied to your products. The easiest way to set a <b>Tax Rate</b> for a group of products is to set it by <b>Category</b><br /><br />

-There is the option to set different tax rates for <b>regular orders</b>, <b>delivery</b>, and <b>take-out</b> orders seperately. Make sure these are set in order to properly calculate and charge taxes.
